        It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of Julian Wiseman
        on Saturday 24th July 2021. Julian's family would like to extend their
        condolences to all of those affected by his loss, particularly to all of
        his students who always meant so much to him. Words cannot express what
        a kind, caring, compassionate and supportive person Julian was and he
        will be sorely missed by everybody who had the pleasure of knowing him.
